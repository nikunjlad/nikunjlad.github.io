# nikunjlad.github.io

Source for Nikunj Lad's personal site powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

## Project description

Personal website for sharing publications, projects, and experience. The site is built with Jekyll and published via GitHub Pages.

## Local development

To work on the site locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
2. Serve the site locally:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   The site will be available at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Deployment

Deployments are handled by GitHub Pages. Pushing to the `main` branch triggers a rebuild and publishes the updated site.

## License and contributing

This project is open source under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests.

## Sidebar navigation

Navigation links in [`_includes/sidebar.html`](./_includes/sidebar.html) are
manually curated instead of generated from all pages. Keeping this list short
helps the template stay concise and highlights the most relevant content.
Add new links directly in that file when necessary.
