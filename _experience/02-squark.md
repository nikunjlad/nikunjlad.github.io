- Worked on developing a system to observe and visualize Bias and ensure Fairness in machine learning systems
 using Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, Average Odds Difference, Disparate Impact and Theil Index Metrics.
- Mitigating Bias and ensuring fairness using optimized pre-processing & adversarial debiasing algorithms.
- Also working on reducing data dimension using t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and developing interpretable
  models using Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME).
