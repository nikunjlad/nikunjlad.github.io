- Worked on Dense Pose Estimation for real-time identification of patients during 
medical examinations
- Implemented multi-threaded architecture for real-time inference of patients using NVidia RTX 2080 GPUs and achieved an 
FPS of ~20-21.
- Developed a technique to acquire skeletal positions of human body by reading depth image frame 
from RGBD images captured using Astra Orbbec Depth Camera.
- Annotated image data using Densepose for keypoint estimation and ran the system on NVidia P5000 GPUs.
