- Worked on [Mouse Brain Image Analysis](https://github.com/nikunjlad/Broad-Institute-Mouse-Brain-Mapping){:target="_blank"} by trying to 
classify sagittal, horizontal and coronal views of images. Used ResNet-50 architecture for training the models on 2 NVidia Tesla T4 GPUs.
- Reduced run-time complexity by 60% by developing micro-services architecture using H2O auto-modeling framework.
- Memory and time profiled metrics on Tensorboard using PyTorch and achieved 2x faster data-loading with Dask.
- Assisted [Dr. Nik Bear Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikbearbrown/){:target="_blank"} in his course of 
[INFO 7390 - Advances in Data Science and Architectures](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/INFO_7390){:target="_blank"} 
and [INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Tools and Methods](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/INFO_6105){:target="_blank"}.
- Conducted Deep Learning workshops on Convolutional Neural Networks for batch of 100+ students. Also managed a batch of
 50 students and assisted them in the academic course.
