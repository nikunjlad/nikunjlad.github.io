- Implemented Dense Correspondence Estimation algorithm for real-time patient inference and increased inference speed
by 50% to ~20-21 FPS using multi-threaded Dockerized architecture on Nvidia P5000 GPU
- Developed a technique to acquire skeletal positions of human body by reading depth image frame 
from RGBD images captured using Astra Orbbec Depth Camera.
- Annotated image data using Densepose for keypoint estimation and ran the system on NVidia P5000 GPUs.
