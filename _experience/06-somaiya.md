- Worked Under [Dr. Jagannath Nirmal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rl16d3UAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, HOD, Electronics Department, KJSCE on industrial Machine Learning and 
Computer Vision applications.
- Worked on a project demanding the need to develop a system to classify Dysphonia patients from normal patients using
Machine Learning. It uses an algorithm which uses a robust feature extraction technique named I-Vectors for classification. 
Entire implementation done in MATLAB and can be migrated into Python packages. Successfully modelled a system which gives 98%
accuracy using the proposed technique as compared to the 92% before using the technique. Used Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
to perform Binary classification.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=is6g3oAAAAAJ&hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3Dis6g3oAAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3Dis6g3oAAAAAJ%3Au-x6o8ySG0sC%26tzom%3D240" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
- Simultaneously worked on another project requiring the need to classify patients with Dysphonia, Paralysis, Laryngitis and Normal.
Used the above proposed technique of I-Vectors to develop 3 different models to classify these 4 classes. Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were used with multi-class functionality. The entire system was developed in MATLAB and can be 
migrated into Python packages.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=is6g3oAAAAAJ&hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3Dis6g3oAAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3Dis6g3oAAAAAJ%3Au5HHmVD_uO8C%26tzom%3D240" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
