Gender and Age Prediction is a fairly challenging task. Determining whether a person is a Male or a
Female is a simple binary classification task. However, determining an age of a person can be pretty 
challenging. It is difficult to get an estimate of a person's age just by their looks. Humans are suprisingly
deceiving and this project is aimed to tackle this challenge of predicting human age and gender from face images.
