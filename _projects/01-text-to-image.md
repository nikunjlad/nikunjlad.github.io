Text-to-Image Metamorphosis is translation of a text to an Image. Essentially, it is 
inverse of Image Captioning. In Image Captioning, given an image, we develop a model to 
generate a caption for it based on the underlying scene. Text-to-Image Metamorphosis, 
generates an image from a corresponding text by understanding the language semantics. In this project
we have developed images of Birds given a caption describing the properties of the bird.
