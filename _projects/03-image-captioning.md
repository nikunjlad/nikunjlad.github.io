What does a particular scene in an image mean? Given an image its easy for humans to describe the scene
and various elements in it, but it is a fairly challenging problem for a computer to do that and yet 
generalize it. This project is an effort to explore image captioning and understand how images are 
captioned with descriptive texts by training a CNN-LSTM hybrid network.
