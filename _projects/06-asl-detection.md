We are privileged as humans to talk and converse and communicate with each other. But what about those people who canâ€™t 
talk or speak? Such people find it hard to convey their ideas. This project is an effort to develop a system to help 
people who cannot speak better to communicate with individuals. We identify all the 26 English alphabets along with 3 
special characters - space, delete, and blanks. The goal is to generate a real-time system to translate signs on the fly.
