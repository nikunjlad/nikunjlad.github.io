This paper is based on classification of various voice disorders using non-invasive methods with the help of Machine Learning
algorithms. In this work, voice samples for three disorders-Dysphonia, Vocal Fold Paralysis and Laryngitis along with normal
speech samples are considered. A comprehensive database for each category (4 classes) is created. Using speech processing
and feature extraction techniques, the relevant features are extracted, which are stored in a supervector using GMM-UBM.
This supervector is then projected on a low dimensional feature vector known as 'i-Vectors' using total variability factor 
analysis. These extracted features are stored and a feature matrix is created. The parameters obtained hereafter are used to 
train the system using Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes and K-NN. The trained system is capable of classification of voice 
disorders. The accuracy using the above-mentioned classifiers is in the range of 84% to 96%.
