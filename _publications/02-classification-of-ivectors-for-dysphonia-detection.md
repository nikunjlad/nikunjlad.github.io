This paper is a comparative study of how Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) can be used for 
classifying three voice disorders - Dysphonia, Vocal Fold Paralysis and Laryngitis along with normal speech samples. For our
study, we made use of the proposed I-Vector Feature extraction technique.
