I am a Computer Vision Developer and Machine Learning engineer currently pursing my masters in Information Systems at 
Northeastern University. With 3 years of experience working in cross functional environments right from being a research
assistant in an academic environment to being a software developer in a startup. I have hands on experience working with
Object Oriented Python and developing computer vision solutions using OpenCV and High-Performance Computing using 
Nvidia CUDA framework. I am strongly interested in developing solutions to solve computer vision problems using Deep Learning.
