title: About me
---

I am a Computer Vision Developer and Machine Learning engineer currently pursing my masters in Information Systems at Northeastern University. With 3 years of experience working in cross functional environments right from being a research assistant in an academic environment to being a software developer in a startup. I have hands on experience working with Object Oriented Python and developing computer vision solutions using OpenCV and High-Performance Computing using Nvidia CUDA framework. I am strongly interested in developing solutions to solve computer vision problems using Deep Learning.
