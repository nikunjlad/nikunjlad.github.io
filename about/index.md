I am a <b>Computer Vision Engineer</b> currently pursing my masters in Information Systems at 
Northeastern University. I am currently assisting [Dr. Nik Bear Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikbearbrown/){:target="_blank"}
as a <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> in the Advanced Data Sciences and Architectures course. 

My work is mostly related to understanding images and videos and trying to find the underlying relationships. Having said that, I 
have worked on various Machine Learning projects as well giving me a good foundation for the same. While, I started off with 
image classification tasks, I have lately worked on captioning images with text, generating images given a text and also real-time
object tracking using OpenCV. A few months ago, I interned in a startup and worked on problems related to Pose Estimation, Dense Correspondence Estimation
and annotation techniques for a medical application. 

I was really fascinated by how our applications can be scaled and parallelized using state-of-the-art computational techniques.
I recently took a subject of <b>Parallel Computing</b> taught by [Dr. Liu Handan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/handan-liu-439050169/){:target="_blank"} 
where I explored strategies and techniques to work on High-Performance Computing platforms like Discovery Clusters. Since then, 
I have been harnessing the power of GPU's for distributed training of the models.

While I am not coding or working on anything related to vision, I love reading psychological-fictional books. Books which help me 
stimulate the left half of my brain, the creative one. The power which lies inside thoughts is far beyond ones imagination and it
is one of the things which mesmerizes me the most. I truly believe this quote:

> <b>"A Man is but the product of his thoughts, what he thinks he becomes"</b> - <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i>

While my life revolves around tech and books most of the time, I have a special space for culinary art and love cooking or 
experimenting on new cuisines. My mother instilled in me this crazy love for food, as she enjoyed serving others via her culinary art;
and I try to carry forward that tradition of giving back and strive to reciprocate her teachings in my life.

I also, happen to explore places ever now and then. Ever place has its own story and I feel sharing personal experiences with others helps
them in the longer run. I am a <b>Google Maps Local Guide</b> and I share my views on places I visited during my time exploring on Google Maps. 
I see Google Maps as a treasure map, with places as markers to be explored, each revealing a new story. While most of the places exist on the 
map, there are many new local businesses which are yet not recognized and after having stumbled across them, I end up adding them on the Map.
