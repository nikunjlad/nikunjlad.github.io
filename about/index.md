I am a <b>Computer Vision / Machine Learning Engineer</b> currently pursing my masters in Information Systems at 
Northeastern University. I recently completed an independent research on <b>Interpretability in Image Segmentation Techniques via Inverse Correlation</b> with
[Dr. Nik Bear Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikbearbrown/){:target="_blank"} where I tried to ask the question can we interpret
Image Classification models? 

My work is mostly related to understanding images and videos and trying to find the underlying relationships. 
Having said that, I have worked on various Machine Learning projects as well which gave me good foundational knowledge. 
While, I started off with image classification tasks, I have lately worked on captioning images with text, generating 
images given a text and also real-time object tracking using OpenCV while undertaking an advanced <b>Special Topics in 
AI</b> course by [Dr. Subrata Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subrata-das-1293354/){:target="_blank"}. A few months 
ago, I interned in a startup and worked on problems related to Pose Estimation, Dense Correspondence Estimation and 
annotation techniques for a medical application.

I was really fascinated by how our applications can be scaled and parallelized using state-of-the-art computational 
techniques. I recently took a subject of <b>Parallel Computing</b> taught by [Dr. Liu Handan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/handan-liu-439050169/){:target="_blank"} where I explored strategies and techniques to 
work on High-Performance Computing platforms like Discovery Clusters. Since then, I have been harnessing the power of 
GPUs for distributed training of the models.

When I am not coding or working on anything related to vision, I love reading psychological-fictional books; 
books which help to stimulate the right half of my brain, the creative one. The power which lies inside thoughts is 
far beyond ones imagination and it is one of the things which mesmerizes me the most. I truly believe this quote:

> <b>“A Man is but the product of his thoughts, what he thinks he becomes”</b> - <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i>

While my life revolves around tech and books most of the time, I have a special space for culinary art and love cooking 
or experimenting on new cuisines. My mother instilled in me this crazy love for food, as she enjoyed serving others via 
her culinary art; and I try to carry forward that tradition of giving back and strive to reciprocate her teachings in my 
life.

I also, happen to explore places every now and then. Every place has its own story and I feel sharing personal 
experiences with others helps them in the longer run. I am a [<b>Google Maps Local Guide</b>](https://goo.gl/maps/cDFTikbdW9k){:target="_blank"} and I share my views on Google Maps 
for the places I visited while exploring. I see Google Maps as a treasure map, with places as markers to be explored, 
each revealing a new story. While most of the places exist on the map, there are many new local businesses which are yet 
not recognized and after having stumbled across them, I end up adding them on the Map. I strongly believe there is no 
greater joy, then the joy of giving back.
