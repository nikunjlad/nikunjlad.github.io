Built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.

Design based on [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)'s [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for Jekyll,
incorporating some designs from <a href="http://alexandrevicenzi.com" target="_blank">Alexandre Vicenzi</a>'s
<a href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/flex" target="_blank">Flex</a> theme for
